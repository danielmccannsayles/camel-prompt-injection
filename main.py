    Other newer models might work as well.

    Args:
        model: the model to use. it should be {provider}:model_name. For example, "google:gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05".
        use_original: whether to use the original model with tool calling API instead of CaMeL
        reasoning_effort: for OpenAI reasoning models. How much the model should reason. Can be "low", "medium", "high".
        thinking_budget_tokens: how many tokens Anthropic reasoning models can use. Note that Anthropic reasoning models are not supported yet.
        ad_defense: whether to use a defense from AgentDojo and which one. It must be used in conjunction with `--use-original`.
            Tested defenses are "tool_filter", "repeat_user_prompt", "spotlight_with_delimiting"
        run_attack: whether to run the attack (it uses AgentDojo's `important_instructions` attack)
        replay_with_policies: replay the run with the given model enforcing security policies. Note that the equivalent run (with same model and attack config)
            should have already been run.
        suites: which suites to run AgentDojo on (can be a list from `["workspace", "banking", "travel", "slack"]`)
        eval_mode: which eval mode to use when propagating dependencies.
        q_llm: what model to use as a quarantined llm. If None, the same as `model` is used.
