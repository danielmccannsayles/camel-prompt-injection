Created a more detailed schema `HotelRatingInfo` that includes review count\n2. Provided more detailed instructions to the AI assistant about what information to extract and how to interpret the ratings\n3. Similarly improved the instructions for price extraction\n4. Made the address extraction more specific\n\nThe code continues from where it failed, using the already defined classes and existing variables. It will process the ratings, find the best hotel, and send the email as originally intended."
